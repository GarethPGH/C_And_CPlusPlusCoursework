However, Algorithms include the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and Doubly Linked List
Files are C++ files, but written using C syntax

# C++ Coursework 

More Algorithm based than general purpose. 
Includes use of various C++ features, Object Oriented Programming, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes and Inheritence 
Algorithms include Towers Of Hanoi, Doubly Linked List, Binary Search, and various math based functions
